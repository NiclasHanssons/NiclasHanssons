### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹
Here can you see some of my finished projects and what I'm currently working on.

It's a mix of desktop applications and web development. At the moment I'm
focusing

on a few of them and trying to have a more clean presentation.

I hope you like what you see and if you have some inputs,
don't hesitate to hit me up! ðŸ˜€

Have a good one!
